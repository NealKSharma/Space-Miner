## 🪐 Theme

You are an **astronaut** whose ship has crash-landed on a barely habitable alien planet.  
The terrain is harsh, oxygen is scarce, and the native lifeforms are not exactly friendly.  

You’ll explore the planet tile by tile — uncovering new areas, finding resources, and learning how to survive in a world that doesn’t want you there.  
Use the materials you collect to **repair your ship** or **build a new one** from the ground up.  

It’s a game about **exploration**, **survival**, and **adaptation** in an unknown world.
